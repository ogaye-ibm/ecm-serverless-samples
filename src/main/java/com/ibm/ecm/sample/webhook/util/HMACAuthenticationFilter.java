/**
 * The {@code HMACAuthenticationFilter} class implements the
 * {@link javax.ws.rs.ext.ReaderInterceptor ReaderInterceptor} class, which
 * combined with the {@code @Provider} annotation allows this class to
 * automatically intercept any requests before they are accepted by the REST
 * servlet.
 * <p>
 * This class handles the validation of the HMAC credentials that are passed by
 * the Content Event Webhook External Event Action. On the Content Platform
 * Engine side, the External Event Action has an External Receiver Credentials
 * (EevEventReceiverCredentials) property, where the user specifies the
 * credential type. In Content Platform Engine 5.5.4, only HMAC credentials and
 * the {@code HmacSHA1} algorithm are supported. The user must specify a secret
 * value in the External Receiver Credentials that matches the secret value on
 * the External Event Receiver application. This secret value is then used as a
 * cryptographic key along with the External Event action payload to generate an
 * HMAC value.
 * <p>
 * The HMC credential serves two purposes:
 * <p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Verify that the External Event Action callout is meant specifically for
 * this Receiver application and not a different Receiver application
 * <li>Validate that the request has not been tampered with and is coming from
 * the trusted sender (the Content Platform Engine server)
 * </ol>
